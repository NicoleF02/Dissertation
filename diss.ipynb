    "The neuronal synapse is underpinned by one of the largest and most diverse proteomes known. We curated the publicly available dataset to describe a landscape of some ~ 8000 proteins found in mammalian synapses. Respective gene information along with subcellular localization, brain region, gene ontology, disease association and protein-protein interactions were stored as SQLite database [1]. Many synaptic protein genes are links to pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental diseases, such as ASD and epilepsy [2], and many others. We aim to extend the database to include all publicly available neurodevelopmental disease mutation, allowing further analysis of possible mechanisms of disease comorbidity via extensive network analysis methods. Recently, we have incorporated this information for ASD by adding to database 9855 unique mutation with known cDNA variant, corresponding to 603 synaptic genes. Next candidate diseases are Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, Unipolar Depression, Huntingdonâ€™s Disease and ALS, although we are flexible to discuss the personal preferences, if any.\n",

Finally, the newly obtained gene- mutation relationships could be further analyzed with various bioinformatics methods, such as disease enrichment of the clustered pre- or post-synaptic networks, generation of Steiner tree/forest for diseases genes in specific compartment, or/and studying possible disease overlap/disjoint with other available disease (e.g. ASD).\n",
