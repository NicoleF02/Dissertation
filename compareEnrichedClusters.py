# WE know all of the enriched clusters from Ora/,,, , we can get the geneoverlap from FullDBClustered and their cluster.
# We want to compare clustering accross different algorithms enrichment, maybe consider it especially clusters

# Basically just compare trub clusters to each other, rand index again




# Read in a csv from the Ora folder, we want to compare the enriched clusters from the different algorithms
